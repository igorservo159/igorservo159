## Hi there, my name is Igor! 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student from Natal, RN, Brazil 🇧🇷. I am very interested in everything about **Python**, **Data Science**, and **AI**. I like to know how things work under the hood, from algorithms to system performance. When I'm not crushing bugs or building dreams, I'll be lifting weights 🏋️, playing some Counter-Strike 🎮, or enjoying time with God ✝️ and my family ❤️.

## 📘 I've worked on: 
- A scientific project implementing an [optimized Periodic Plus Smooth Decomposition algorithm](https://github.com/igorservo159/optimized-periodic-smooth-decomposition) for removing boundary artifacts on 2D FFTs.
- A [transportation problem solver](https://github.com/igorservo159/transportation-problem-solver) implemented using the general simplex algorithm.
- A wave equation solver accelerated with CUDA + MPI.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on: 
- A scientific research project at UFRN, financed by the German company Scontain, focused on [Confidential Computing 🔐](https://github.com/ufrn-seclab).

## 👀 I'm looking to:
- Build a strong portfolio in AI engineering, with clean architecture, MLOps, and edge deployment.  
- Deepen my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system optimization.
- Practice LeetCode regularly to improve logic and problem-solving fluency.  
- Learn to write clean, testable code using TDD, modular design, and performance profiling.
